## Availity Challenge

This is my submission for the Availity Front End Developer Role

Below are my answers to the questions asked and then if you run this code you can see the registration form and LISP code run.

1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can be a personal or school
   project. **I have many to think of, one that has got me here today is in 2008 I was laid off from a design job and spent my time on unemployment to teach myself programming to get a better job. I learned Python and Django to start off**

2. Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why
   you like it and why you should recommend I do the same. **I just finished the book Can't Hurt Me. This book is a must read and will open new ways to realize we can all achieve the things we want with a little more mental focus.**

3. If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say? **So I would tell this 7 year old that Availity is like the game Plants vs. Zombies and that the plants are keeping the zombies from getting past and getting to the information they can use for bad. But if you are not a zombie and need to get past you can then get to the information and help that they provide to get healthcare coverage.**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
